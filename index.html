      Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic which are less than 5mm in length, which can potentially be found in drinking water. 
      Although not much is known about the effect that microplastics can have on human health, it is very well known that microplastics
      can cause damage to the internal structures of aquatic life and can even potentially be fatal to them, so it is important to remove 
      them from drinking water to prevent any potential harm that can be caused to humans.  
      However, there are ways to remove these microplastics, for example when there are optimized operating conditions over 70% of 
      microplastics under 13 µm, or another way to remove microplastics is through water treatment plants, where primary treatment can remove 
      16.5% to 98.4% of microplastics and secondary treatments can remove 78.1% to 100% of microplastics and tertiary treatments can remove 87.3% 
      to over 99.9% of microplastics in the water.

      Conclusion:
      In conclusion there are many ways to remove microplastics in water and this paper outlines a couple of them and shows that they each have their advantages and disadvantages,
      for example we can see that water treatment plants can remove a lot more microplastics then just coagulation mechanisms, however the water treatment plants also create a lot of excess sludge, 
      which can also cause microplastic pollution within the environment, this tells us that more research is needed on the topic of removing microplastics in water to find a solution that is both the most effective and the most environmentally friendly.
