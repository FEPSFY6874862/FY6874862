      Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic which are less than 5mm in length, which can potentially be found in drinking water. 
      Although not much is known about the effect that microplastics can have on human health, it is very well known that microplastics
      can cause damage to the internal structures of aquatic life and can even potentially be fatal to them, so it is important to remove 
      them from drinking water to prevent any potential harm that can be caused to humans.  
      However, there are ways to remove these microplastics, for example when there are optimized operating conditions over 70% of 
      microplastics under 13 µm, or another way to remove microplastics is through water treatment plants, where primary treatment can remove 
      16.5% to 98.4% of microplastics and secondary treatments can remove 78.1% to 100% of microplastics and tertiary treatments can remove 87.3% 
      to over 99.9% of microplastics in the water.

      Microplastics are generally characterised as water-insoluble, solid polymer particles that are under 5mm in size (NOAA, 2024). 
      Many studies have been done on microplastics and their presence within freshwater and drinking water, 
      with many studies finding anywhere between 10^-2 to 10^8 microplastics per m^3 (Peter Marsden, 2019). These large numbers can be very worrying as although not much is known about the effect that microplastics can have on humans,
      and there is some debate about whether microplastics have any effect on humans at all, what is well known about is the effect they have on fish and other aquatic species. 
      Microplastics are extremely dangerous for fish and aquatic species because they damage the internal structures of them and this damage in some cases can even kill the animal. 
      This damaging effect that these microplastics have on wildlife have caused scientists to try and come up with methods of removing them from sources of water in order to prevent any negative effects on health they may have and to help 
      protect the wildlife that may inhabit these sources of water. Methods that have been studied to remove microplastics include coagulation mechanisms and water treatment plants, both of these processes have been used to remove
      microplastics from drinking water and both of these processes have their own individual efficiencies and drawbacks when it comes to treating drinking water and this article looks to better understand the benefits and downsides of both.

      Conclusion:
      In conclusion there are many ways to remove microplastics in water and this paper outlines a couple of them and shows that they each have their advantages and disadvantages,
      for example we can see that water treatment plants can remove a lot more microplastics then just coagulation mechanisms, however the water treatment plants also create a lot of excess sludge, 
      which can also cause microplastic pollution within the environment, this tells us that more research is needed on the topic of removing microplastics in water to find a solution that is both the most effective and the most environmentally friendly.
